# HeadHeart
This is the repository for my master thesis done in the Tan Lab at the MRC Brain Networks Dynamics Unit of the Univerity of Oxford. The thesis is completed for the FU Berlin and supervised by Huiling Tan (University of Oxford).

This project investigates how the brain processes signals from the heart during rest, using simultaneous EEG, subthalamic nucleus (STN) LFP, and ECG recordings from 14 Parkinson’s disease patients after DBS surgery. We compare neural dynamics with and without levodopa medication and analyse the mechanisms behind the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP).

Key findings show that levodopa increases HEP amplitude, while power, phase, and ECG features remain stable. Inter-trial coherence reveals strong phase-locking in the high-delta to low-theta range (2–5 Hz) ~100–250 ms after the R-peak, supporting a phase-resetting mechanism underlying HEP generation. The results highlight delta and theta phase dynamics as core contributors to heart–brain coupling and suggest that levodopa modulates interoception centrally rather than peripherally.
